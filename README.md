# philosophy-existentialism-project

In a parallel universe, all guidance counsellors have been replaced with philosophers! 👴🧓 And not just any old philosophers, but existentialist ones! 

You have been tasked with determining the efficacy of these new guidance counsellors. Your assignment is to snoop in on the conversations held between various students and guidance counsellors and ensure these drastic substitutions have been beneficial for the student body. 🔍
